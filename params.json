{"name":"Hands on Demand @ Hacking Medicine NYC Hackathon 4/5-4/6 2014","tagline":"HandsOnDemand is like TaskRabbit + LinkedIn + Uber + Coursera for Healthcare","body":"### Welcome to HandsOnDemand.\r\n\r\n## The Problem\r\n\r\nAmerican unemployment has stagnated at 6.7%.  Meanwhile, the types of work needed in healthcare are changing, and more help is needed than ever.  This includes home care, care coordination, disease management and other roles part of team-based, patient-centered care.\r\n\r\nHandsOnDemand matches people of all levels of skills to work opportunities that patients, caregivers and healthcare organizations need to be able to scale on-demand.\r\n\r\n## The Inspiration\r\n\r\nAmazon Web Services has demonstrated that computing can be elastic -- that is, scaled up and down as needed at a moment's notice.  Unfortunately, the healthcare workforce is not the same.  Full-time jobs are the mainstay of healthcare organizations, and when needs change quickly, or spikes in activity happen (healthcare.gov anyone?), staffing the right people to the right tasks can be tough.  So we're introducing a system to help that, which makes it possible to go a small as a single task to as large as an entire virtual call center to say, support readmission risk reduction programs or insurance navigation for newly-insured Americans, or do home visits and assessments for Medicare Advantage plans.\r\n\r\n## How is this different than TaskRabbit or Care.com?\r\n\r\nHandsOnDemand not only will do a background check, but provides additional authentication and credibility for the service providers by using LinkedIn and other social networks.  This creates a credibility score for all of the providers that helps you ensure not only that they are credible, but also have the skills you're looking for.  And as a \"helping hand\" provider, you can get work faster.\r\n\r\n## No, really, how is it different?  e.g. if I'm a healthcare organization?\r\n\r\nIf you're a healthcare organization -- say, the medical management arm of a health insurer, or a hospital looking to reduce readmissions, or even a startup trying out a new health care service -- you can staff up a workforce in a flexible, skills-focused fashion.  Rather than hiring full-time staff, you can pay for the actual amount of work done.  From telephonic patient education, care coordination, health advocacy to in-home assessments, HandsOnDemand can supply the work you need.  \r\n\r\n## How much do I get paid if I want to be a Helping Hand?\r\n\r\nYou can set what you'd like -- we'll suggest what most folks are willing to pay for a service or task.  \r\n\r\n## I'm a Helping Hand.  How can I get paid more?\r\n\r\nWe'll match you up with discounts on training programs -- and also give you certified Experience Points rating for skills to add to your resume -- to upgrade your skill set, so you can be eligible for more work, higher-skilled and work, and at higher rates.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
